# Real-Transilvania-Website

	Real Transilvania official website is a basic website created for Real Transilvania team, 
	which are currently playing in Athletic Union League, Premier A. The website that I create start 
	with a background image that represent the logo of Transilvania team. In the top section of 
	the page I create a header adding the name of the club and the logo. Throughout in the right side of the 
	header there is social media icons, where if user click on a respective image, brings it on an external page. 
	For example, if you press on the Facebook icon, its brings you to the Real Transilvania official Facebook page. 

	Followed true on my HTML, I create a white bar and added a searching box, where users can navigate more easily 
	by searching for a specific file, or a different topic. Then on the right side of the white bar I add a login 
	section where user can login if have already an account and if doesn`t, beside login section there is an create 
	account section and users can create their own personal account. Underneath the white bar is the navigation menu. 
	Users can easily navigate through different pages and view different information that Real Transivania is offer, 
	such us the current news of Real Transilvania family, users can view all the player, photos, videos, etc. 
	In the HTML Container I split this section in two parts. In the left side I added a section where user can view 
	the most important news of Real Transilvania team, and underneath I create another section with latest news of 
	the team. If click on the news it`s brings in to another page, where there is more information about that news topic. 
	On the right side of the container I create in html two tables where who visit the website can see the next match 
	that Trasilvania is going to have and bellow the other table with Premier A league table, where the team is enrolled 
	at the moment. Basically, this website was creating for Real Transilvania fans and for all users, which they can have 
	the opportunity to see news about the first team and also about second team. All the news in the website are up to date 
	weekly keeping fans with a fresh memory of what is happening in Real Transilvania family.
